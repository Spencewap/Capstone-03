# Capstone-03

This repository contains the work done by myself and three others in completing our third and final capstone while we were enrolled in Tech Elevator in Fall 2020. 
This capstone includes the use of Vue.js and Springboot in order to create a comic book application that consumes the Marvel Comics API.

The idea behind this appplication is to create an online comic bookshop presence with the ability to interact with friends and others who also share the comic book passion through trading, leaderboard recognition of comic book collections, etc..

Please keep in mind this project was developed with a hard-stop timeframe of two weeks, so expect certain features to not be fully compatible or fleshed out as well as bugs.
